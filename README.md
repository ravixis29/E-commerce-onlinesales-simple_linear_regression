# E-commerce-onlinesales-simple_linear_regression

I have tried to create a simple linear regression model from a E-commerce online sales data,predicted the amount spent by customers on a training dataset and comparing it with test dataset.
My key metrics are as follows:-
MAE: 7.228148653430832
MSE: 79.81305165097456
RMSE: 8.93381506697864

Also I have tried to answer a question whether company should focus more on websites or mobile apps with the help of ce-efficients.
My findings are as follows-

1. For 1 unit increase in Time on App, it is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent. 

2. For 1 unit increase in Time on Website, it is associated with an increase of 0.19  total dollars spent.
